# Read Me Assignment 4

Alt-Text is used as an alternitive text in place of an image that tells the nature of or what an image is. This way if the image doesnt show up the user can know what the image is.

One form I read about online is the optgroup tag, it is used in a drop down window and allows you to group your different options in a sub group.

### Example of optgroup

~~~~<select>
  <optgroup label="Swedish Cars">
    <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
    <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  </optgroup>
  <optgroup label="German Cars">
    <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
    <option value="audi">Audi</option>
  </optgroup>
</select>~~~~

***
This week was very dense and hard to work through , and Im having trouble remember the syntax for each form, and its feeling overwhelming. It took me along time to get through this assignment.

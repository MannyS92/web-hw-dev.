# Assignment 5

B.) Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

The Div tag is used as a capsule to help organize the different parts of the html document.
Classes are use to refer to certain style sheets for CSS.
ID tags are used to help you style different elements specifically.
Span tag is used to organize inline elements in a document.

C.) Why might I consider third-party over self-hosted media?

Self hosted media can get expensive if your media uses a lot of bandwidth, but if you use a third party host , you can upload high qualty media and the host will take care of the bandwidth.

This week was a little easier than last week, I feel like Im starting to get html a little better. But Im still a little confused how classes are used but I assume this will make more sense as we move into CSS.

    <pre>     I have eaten
     the plums
     that were in
     the icebox

                 and which
                 you were probably
                 saving
                 for breakfast
                                 <strong><em>Forgive Me</em></strong>
                                 they were delicious
                                 so <strong>sweet</strong>
                                 and so <strong><em>cold</em></strong>.
